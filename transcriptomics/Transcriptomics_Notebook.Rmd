# Transcriptomics Notebook

## October 10, 2024

-   we started the transcriptomics unit

-   lots of great notes on the 01_DESeq2_explore file

-   the countsTable has all the data in it that we will work with

    -   we have to round that data since DESeq2 is wimpy

-   we looked at the Column and Row data from the counts matrix

-   made a barplot

-
